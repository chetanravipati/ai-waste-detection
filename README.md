## 📌 Project Overview

Manual waste segregation is time-consuming and inefficient. This project uses Artificial Intelligence to automate waste classification using image processing techniques.

The system can analyze images of waste and classify them into categories such as:

- Plastic
- Metal
- Paper
- Organic
- Glass

This helps improve recycling efficiency and supports smart city solutions.
